# PyBer Analysis

### Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to compare the weekly fares in rural, suburban, and urban cities. By using Python and MatPlotLib we were able to compare each city type to one
another and see the total amount of rides taken in each city type, how many drivers provided those rides, the total amount of money that city type earned in the timeframe of our analysis, and the average fare per ride and per driver.



### Results
In our PyBer analysis Urban cities had the most activity among the city types. 
Rural cities had a total of 1,625 rides, provided by 2,405 drivers which totaled $39,853.38 
The average fare per ride was $34.62 and the average fare per driver was $55.49

Suburban cities were the second most active city type with 625 total rides, provided by 490 drivers totaling $19,356.33
The average fare per ride was 30.97 and the average fare per driver was $39.50

Finally, Rural cities had the least activity with 125 total rides, provided by 78 drivers totalling $4,327.93.
The average fare per ride was $34.62 and the average fare per driver was $55.49.

### Summary
Based on this analysis we can tell that PyBer rides in rural cities were much more expense than rides in urban areas. This makes sense as the population of urban areas
are substantially higher than in rural areas, and there probably just aren't enough drivers to be able to provide the number of rides in those areas. A recommendation to our CEO would be to incentivise people living in rural areas to become PyBer drivers, ultimately lowering the average price of taking a PyBer and allowing more people to take Pyber's. A second recommendation would be to have designated pick up and drop off location in rural areas. The average fare per driver in rural areas was more than triple the amount in urban areas. This is most likely because drivers have to driver greater distances, and if there were designated locations to be picked up nd dropped off, kind of like a bus stop, then hopefully yhe driver would not have to driver as far, lowering the cost of taking a PyBer is rural areas. My last recommendation was by the increase the price of taking a PyBer in urban areas. The total rides in urban cities compared to rural cities is 13 times higher in urban cities, yet the average fare per ride is $10 less in urban cities. I believe if Pyber increased their prices in urban areas it would result is a slight decrease in the number of rides taken but would also result in a greater return at the end of the day, since people are willing to pay $10 more for a ride.
